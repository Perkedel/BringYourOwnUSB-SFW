## family guy moment

Uncle Furto: (Key to `ON`), Okay, kids! make sure you're ready.. (hold twist `START`)!........

Starter fail to spin correctly, error shows up on cluster

Furto: (starter jammed?) Awh man!!.. dangit???!.. Uh.. kids! need some help here!

Lala: (come to van prepared attire) Yes uncle?

Furto: Time to push this down the hill. The starter broke.

Lala: YAAY!! PUSH THE CAR TIME!!

*everyone kids*: YAAAAAAAAAAAYY!!

### Resident East Gate

Furto: (set gear to `1`, hold brake, hold clutch), okay kids, hit it!

kids pushes the car onto the steep hill

*everyone*: hyaa, hyaa, hyaa, hyaah!!

car rolls very fast. The momentum should be enough

Furto: Okay here goes nothing, (slowly release clutch)....

torque box bit & spun the engine, the car shake virgorously and successfully started

Furto: YESS, okeh. Kids, thank you, (press `Open all back sliding door`)!.

kids come and reclose door.

Furto: Right. Before we go to Posko Gaming Vacation Island, we must fix the starter.

### Car Service

Goot: (walk to the customer)..., Mr., Furto?

Furto: Yes?

Goot: The capacitor blew (usual). But the starter motor seems fine. May I ask when last time you've done a service?

Furto: uhhh I don't know, forgot, hehe

Goot: hmm..

Furto: I think I never change it I guess

Curug: (car certificate serial number matches with the bind for starter assembly serial number) Yep, he never changed it ever before.

Goot: Oh wow!.. When did you have this car?

Furto: Ummmm 2140?

Goot: Daang.. (noticed the certificate says that the brand is directly comes from DNB) And that's a government brand you know.

Furto: Uhh yeah. My.. my older brother told me to choose this. I.. despised. It's a manual car, who the hell drives manual these days?

Goot: No don't get me wrong, manual car extincts you know, car brands now despise them by making it a cheapoturd in terms of specs!.. Anyway, what would you should have?

Furto: Shoulmex?

Goot: (Brand that's notorious for planned obsolesence?) Ooooooof.. tough choice kid.. That scum in a luxury coat? Haah ðŸ˜‚??

Furto: What?! Why?? That's an EV!!

Goot: Yes, but that doesn't matter. You know.. there has been a pattern lately when we service those cars. What breaks is just the engine ECU! They're looked fine. Bla bla bla, until we found a scandalous discovery, **they do that** (Planned Obsolesence firmware, must be serviced by the Shoulmex themselves). So we hacked the firmware, tie off of that scum if we had, which we luckily don't. And there it is, Reverse engineered Open source ECU... yeah. You better sell that, NO, throw it away. Noone shall have it. Buy your brand.

Furto: Uhh okay. But this... Racetrack.. only has manual! Not even electric Matic or anything that assist the manual!

Goot: No, trust me, you'll thank Racetrack ever. AI (Robo help you clutch & shift manual car) succ!! Torque, or even CVT? Beugh...! Nah, nothing beats Manual.

Furto: (felt on way remote page)... I am not enthusiast.

Goot: Oh c'mon, do I know you? Furto. the first Machinary Doctorate of 2130s graduated highest GPA.

Furto: (embarrassed) Sir.. I used to 

Goot: And look at you! So much genius you became an Overseer for everything cars. Nobody around us in this realm here are into it.

Furto: I just want to help... eeh...

Goot: Just take it. Be grateful you're older brother is actually also a genius choosing you that. You know??

Curug: (give bill)..!

Goot: C'mon. (slide the bill in) Don't sink yourself in a non-sense FOMO of ***Electrifications***, We got already reliable stuffs at our hand. And that car, already supports Sdexm fuel (Bio-combustible fuel made out of tea leaf leftovers & few of Explosive Flower petals) out of the box you know (hence least polution but tea aroma), **PLANT!!!**, (look bill).. See, this one's cheap. Other brands can't say that, with quality you know

Furto: ... (give ID card)

Goot: (take & swipe to EDC)....

Furto & kids proceed to go.

## Bonus

Help translate Joel's name!!

`Joel` in Hebrew means `Son of God`. Here's the keyword you can choose to consider picking words (for Wordic language) or Dictionary conversion

- Son of God
- Descendant of Deity
- Offspring of the Creator

For family name, `Justiawan` is mashup of mom's & dad's name. just like the case of Asriel. Sorry, we cannot retell their name right now, maybe later. Anyways This can't be easily translated, and currently we are still arguing whether you could use `Perkedel` (Fried Mash Potato) or something new. We forgot Joel's original family name. It's been a long time.

## What is Racetrack

Racetrack is a car brand for car enthusiast. Not just a racing team & the car for it, but now provides every form of car possible, including motorcycles. Unlike the main brand Van Elektronische, Racetrack focuses on enthusiasm which are Controls, Experience, and Sensastion. Of course, like Van Elektronische, They never ommit Safety & Innovation.

Because of the way this brand works, Racetrack do not have Matic transmission (Because AI succ). There's only Manual, Shift Rod, & Complicated Manual (un-matic'd Dual Clutch). Despite Retro product, they still have the luxury electronics of Van Elektronische complete with sophisticated hybrid cluster, & smart infotainment. Although, they have EV, they couldn't find viable reason for other than EV race. Therefore most Racetrack car sold are all Petrol & Diesel.

Racetrack also obeys Van Elektronische oath, by making sure cars lasts forever beyond the owner & just before Rapture. This car Furto had, is been here all the way back since the Merger days of Arenod Sediron. There never new release like *All new Van 2050*, 90, whatever, no. The model & evolution are just those. And it's very simple because the founder hates complicated numbering. So it's just called whatever this is, which is `Van`. Sorry, `Alphard` is taken. Anyway, so to make it *All new*, the owner just have to upgrade which part have been updated, that's it. If there's hardware mega-update, then there's Upgrade kits you can buy. Software, download firmware update! Simple. Just like every DNB stuffs.

Racetrack are sold cheap (starting from 250k Pts), cheaper than the cheapest Van Elektronische car because the founder thinks nobody but niche amount of enthusiasts wants it. It's manual, No EV, just.. many *minus* (No, that's a lie, it still has sophisticated like whatever Rocye it is) and it's just desirable. Joel if asked even wouldn't daily drive it. Store it to dust and use EV instead. So much undesirable, Arenod Sediron ordered people at Van Elektronische to help their sub-brand do something, by making e.g. Matic gear kit to un-manual the shifter & EV transformation. And thankfully, enterprise starts using it with those mods. Btw, Racetrack was about to name the modpack `Unenthusiastic`, `Soulless` (EV Transformation Kit), but DNB deems the names racist & derogatory, so it's now `Assistive` & `Ultra-Stealth` (EV Transformation kit). Despite that, even the most noble customer from DNB still use the racist names, because they are not liar & it sounds more badass. 

Okay, but Van Elektronische has Enterprise vehicle! Nope, still expensive. For some reason, and for some realm, they just desire to cut budgets as much as possible. Van Elektronische in theory, lets you drop of the parts you don't need. It's just the same. We don't know why. But there is a why if they say about the manual transmission & diesel, because Van Elektronische only has EV (& with Genset sometimes) from the start of this business sector of car & motorcycle. Others also say Convert to EV but stay the manual just for funny stuffs.

Another reason was the design. Van Elektronische insist on very beautiful, aerodynamic, & symetrical design. While Racetrack it can be anything crazy. People chose Racetrack sometimes to avoid attentions, as here in many DNB realms, having Van Elektronische automatically means you are Sultan, even tho the car you have is the cheapest model. Some people hates paparazzi effect caused by the stereotype built with Van Elektronische.
