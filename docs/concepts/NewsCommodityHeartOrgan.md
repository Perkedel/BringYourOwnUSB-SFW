(woman voice) Arenod Sediron has announced a medical surgery service where ones can now replace their heart with a *3D printed* ones. They claimed these made up hearts to be better at any aspect than having to rely on donors. They call this `Commodity Heart Organ` or CHO for short.  
Arenod Sediron hospital is one of the first provider of such service.

Interviewer bot: Please describe this new medical service.

Fetal Arenod Sediron: (subtitle `Head of Surgeon`) Yes. We have announced that now you can quickly replace your heart with what do we have here. We've been researching made up heart organ since long, and.. after we squashed bugs, it is now here.

Interviewer: Fascinating.., Why do you provide this service?

Fetal: I mean... ordinary hearts out of the box have.. problems. e.g., it is susceptible to artery blockage and any other clogs which can starve its muscle. We build our heart that removes this trouble, full of redundancy, and very strong materials so these can last very long & hopefully problem free. It hopefully therefore adds lifespan as we speak.

Arenod Sedion has started the project since 1973. Since then, they have improved important aspect of cardiovascular system of one being as time goes. Initially, the completed

Fetal: (hold a bottle of Showcase Commodity Blood) So, this bottle right here is a blood sample. Yeah, it's.. in highlighter yellow, but uncolored still red for Iron version. This one is just for show, so it's not creepy.., Basically.. we also improve the blood so it can efficiently grab Oxygen or whatever chemicals our clients desire, and the target organ should be able to take it that off easily. Like.., *Velcro*, or a magnet very strong, but has an eject button by the time the delivery arrives.

Interviewer: Overall, how much would this surgery costs?

Fetal: Eh.. not much. We tried to press it to this day.., right now it's at 500 Pts for the kit, and installation is 1500 Pts. Still manual tho, we're still working for the robot. Don't worry, even after we finished the robot, the professionals had to watch it still, they infact.. will teach 'em everyday. We got dummies, always trained. Robots, not just alive being.

Currently, Arenod Sediron state that the service is only available for emergency, whenever it is really needed. However, other peers across DNB have made petitions so that these customizable heart be available at all times e.g. to replace already working heart but of course poses risk of mentioned susceptibility. Thankfully, Arenod Sediron has listened and is working on this consideration. Considering such CHO's mass producibility has much been improved into an appropriate viability level.

Fetal: We can customize these heart to whatever shape we want. We also working on nano-sized for uh.. worms too, uh.. just.. yeah for fun. But.. turns out there are indeed fairies, their body so small, so yeah we gotta cater that too.

Interviewer: Do you aware of any risk from this service?

Fetal: Oh yes. So uh.. (point out random blood vessel, brain) We have to install.. limiters because, the blood vessel is also not strong, and can explode if we forgot to limit it as it beats super fast. (release point out, return to expressing) If you want to..- maximize the capability of these hearts, then the whole blood vessels also need replacement. (aware that's' gonna be way too long) HOOOof!! uh.. nah.. you should know that how long it is. So yeah... umm..

Arenod Sediron apparently is still improving all of the science they are doing as time goes. With this milestone available for all publics, this sure hopefully helps alot and reduce number of deaths caused by heart problems.
