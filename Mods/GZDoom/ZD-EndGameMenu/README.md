Small MENUDEF to add `End Game` menu just like in original vanilla DOOM. Or in today's case: KEX because of *advanced* UI/UX-ing.

This time, it's on the Main Menu / Pause Menu, just like in KEX. The same image you see on the Vanilla *fits like a glove* in Main Menu, because Vanilla's Option menu also uses Big Font too! And until it goes to ZDoom etc., you get the point.

**Mind you that**, we currently have no idea how to hide `End Game` when not playing the game / just started the game. That, requires advanced ZScripting of some sort
