	I know, it's useless. If you'd like to quit, then just QuitGameMenu
	and to New Game, then just NewGameMenu.
	The EndGameMenu is there because there is e.g. go back to selector interface
	like above WolfDoom ZDoom TC. Or in your case: KEX ultimated options of
	Mod manager menu & Change Game menu, which only available if you are not in game.
	Huh. wonder how to replicate that in GZDoom. I don't like to separate Engine
	just to make TVLeanback Game selector menu, like KEX with KEX HTML Game selector menu
	Very inellegant! 1 Engine, covers all. HAhaa, ikr, impossible.
	btw, if you want to Wolfenstein, then just ECWolf already.
	I sensed shenanigans around here 
	but I am not allowed to tell in this Source Code Repository.
	Still, remember to officially buy the games on Steam, to blend in.
