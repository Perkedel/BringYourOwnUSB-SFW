### Posko Gaming Resort Westeko

Ukinami Yuzuha: (reel down the hook with ~~shopping list~~ employment form)!..... Hehehehe...

Alice Thymefield: (peacefully sleeping)...

Yuzuha: (poke her soft left ear with the paper gently)! ! ! !

Alice: (annoyed, awakened) mmh!!, (open eyes)????

## Bonus

The blue protogen is speaking again!

Joel Robert Justiawan: Sometime you have to see both side of job fields of different type. One one hand, my mom were recontracted again until her 60s because the company couldn't find another fitting people for the job. She therefore had more than 1 Handles that time. On the other hand, compute job sector has become hell. Since all you do is do this, they can just plop the AI in and remove the real hands. They don't care. As long as the profit it goes, they go. No, If you see the leak as you see here now you can laugh (Veo3 e.g.). But in my today, they're just..., good. But hey, at least I got to pre-download the vibed 3D model just in case, where real hand could only paywall it right? Where's the 3D model of this specific character, as there is only 1 real hand and it's paywalled, and 1 vibed for public domain (because even with DNB, I say no, uncopyrightable)? It's your fault. We're in the same situation. Can't find job that fit, where only option is to become wage & decrease your life span with stress coz you don't fit. But atleast..... We can solve this together. I'm just... yeah, we can join together. Be the exclusive contractor, for me. (appear the DNB employment form) Sign here, but wait, read.
