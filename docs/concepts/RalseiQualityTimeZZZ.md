## Extras

- Surreal Blender Meme x Deltarune is based on Honkai Star Rail battle system, with added Deltarune ACT & SPARE.
- Deltarune New Paradigm, the remake, will also follow Star Rail. wish me luck
- Since you are going to either ACT or FIGHT, unfortunately, the Auto option will likely be gone.
- Don't worry, on Cutscene you still have Auto button. Toby, you should've had!
- Maybe we should add AUTO FIGHT or ACT SPARE options?
- Folks, You also have to make sure cutscener uses Simple ZZZ Dialog mode, add Genshin dynamics, & auto button! So it goes to Deltarune's. Ignore ZZZ Character Dialoged, ZZZ Cutscene video
