## Intro

## Conflict of Interest

After reaching the Semicolon realm, The adventurer began setting up the publication camp. Once again, the Realizer is not recommended to decide how the campaign software published. It is now up to the Complainer, George, to set it up, as we think he knows what he's doing, right?

### Semicolon Front field

Nard: Okay. We're finally here. Okay, I'll setup the camp, and.., (give pen) George, now's your time.

George: Alright. (nervous because of this about of betrayal)..., Here goes.. anything. ..., (depart to the form podium)....

Bidt: Wow.., I never been having adventure myself. Or better, togetherselves. Don't you think?

Nard: Oh yeah. ... We sat for nothing here. First, the politics (of Godot), the loss of hope, and finally, parents retirement. ... Yeah, Idk, who should we blame for this. ...

George: (run back with written form)!!!!!, Guys. The Campaign!

Nard: (put Campaign box on center of carpet) Just to remind you one last time, George. We already tried. We ask people to donate for nothing in return. People will not like it and resume donating to Bathub streamer & any other slops that shouldn't desserve this anyway the point is: This is not gonna work. We tried. Do you understand?

George: But hey! Atleast it was a fun adventure right! Like Joel said, go explore places. Just Mall is okay, you don't have to go to Peaks. You're walking! You touched grass!!... fake tho.. a ceramic tile..

Bidt: Oh.. I'm flattered.

George: You're welcome. I'm sorry, I just want you guys to find money yourself. (began taping the form), wants it to scrounge, or maybe become bathub streamer yourself, any measure (take tape again)... (uh oh, almost self expose) I mean..

Nard: ...

George: ... There.

Nard: (take box, all standup) Okay. Let's do this.

all walk to the submission podium. .........

Nard: (put box) straight to the point.

Everyone returned to their camp and take rest. Everyone is waiting. The few hour came. And the Itch page now setup.

Nard: Hey look, our itch page! (notice paywallism) wait a minute... HUH?!??!

it's $12.99

Nard: NO no no no no NOOO!!! Mr. Semicolon, we must've made a typo!!

Bidt: Brother look! it's still `Draft`!

Nard: .... (upsetly slow turn head towards George)..., George.. what did you say to the form, George? (said *calmly*)

George: Guys... I'm sorry. But you've been very poor. And poorer ever since Joel's parent both retired. No job. You can no longer scrounge. You must *pay rent to the landlord*.

Nard: Kid..., we don't have rent, but yes foods. Perkedel was built to exclusively make software always for Gratis. The only reason for revenue are for Hardwares, *scrounging*, and Commissions.

George: Sorry Sir, but... this world hates us and any fantasy like this they consider it delusional delulu! (walk towards confirm button) I have to

Nard: (draw sword upsetly)!.... Over my dead body. Do not make Perkedel betray what has been defined by scratch.

George: (defensively take riffle)!.., Sir!- I don't want to fight. But we must try betraying just this time, we have lost all hope. We gotta try crazy ideas so who knows just **1** would listen we beg!..

Nard: (charge) HYAAAA!!!

George: Shit (fire)!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Nard: (deflect with sword)!!!!!, (reach & slash) HEUNGGGG

George: (dodge) fuck!!! (land)!!.....

Game begin.

Nard: George! How dare you betrayed Perkedel Technologies?!

George: Please I beg you! You must ignore the sparsdaters & betray our old friend so we can live!!

Bidt: GUYS! PLS DON'T FIGHT!! YOU WILL HURT AND SCRONCH!!

...

You won the battle

Nard: (got hit with bullet) UOOOH UOOOH UOOH......

...

Nard: (critical sat on ground)....

George: ... (guilty of friendly fire, drop riffle)!! (approach Nard)!!..... Sir, you okay?

Nard: No, let's go home. We're done.

George: Hooh, thank God.

Semicolon: Atas nama George Taunt.., Halaman Itch sudah `Published` otomatis dari admin.. .. uh.. wait that's not right. No wait, (call Joel)!!.... (communicate)!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.....

Nard: (give up, stand up & walk home in disappointment)!!... ........ C'mon Bidt.

Bidt: (disappointedly follow Nard)..

George: Wait... No.. This is awry... Atleast the GitHub Release will be there right? .. .. ummm.. The worst case scenario pledge says so!

Semicolon: Sorry sir.. the admin decided, that waits. Now there's only Source Code on GitHub. Btw, Nard is verified of ignoring the Steam APIs very well.

George: Yes, good, but not now... This is..... .. Argh shit (run follow Nard & Bidt)..... (Nard & Bidt already left the scene 12 second past, the door still locked) Uh... Semi?

Semicolon: Oh yes, sorry, (open door)!

Door open

George: (run leave realm)!!...

## No Clarification Allowed anymore

### Realizer HQ one last time

George: (run desperately) hhh hhh hh hhh hhh hh!

It's night time, the Realizer main Keraton dome is closed

George: Argh shit! Argh.. I should sleep

Phone ring, it's from Semicolon

George: Huh?.. (answer)!

Semicolon: Hello, this is Semicolon Publication. Is this George Taunt from The Poors?

George: Yeah? What's going on?

Semicolon: Get out from there. There's Civil War.

George: Ci.. Civil War? in DNB?

Semicolon: Internal, Civil War. For your safety you must immediately evac yourself back to your home, right now.

George: Okay okay, (minimize phone call), (open portal to back home)!!, (jump)!

### Home. Bedroom

George: (close)!... Uh... this is bad

Semicolon: Hey, you tried your best. Yes, there's bad reviews, and beg for it to be free. And even nobody care that Joel is poor. But atleast, the sparsdaters are sparsdating the Steam emulationers, We won!... the money.

George: (potentially huge offer)..... Uh.. here's the thing. Keep the cut, don't transfer it to me. Case closed. I was reckless, and I want to resign.

Semicolon: Arranged. But hence your adventure will end here and you will go to credit.

George: (sigh)..........., If only I can reverse time, and uh...

Semicolon: (*Choose Pacifist Route*) I'm sorry but that's not possible. This is not Deltarune. Perkedel Cinematic Universe runs synchronously with Joel's real life. It's already happened.

George: ...

Semicolon: Rest up. And wait for the result.

George: Wait I didn't get to (`say goodbye` got cut)

The Game abruptly ended. Credit roll.
